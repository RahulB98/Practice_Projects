I am applying for financial aid because this is the time of my life when I seriously need to learn coding so that I can build my career, I want to persue a craeer that involves around coding and Data science, but me being a student and already having my hands full with academics cannot afford to pay the fees for the course this is the reason why I require financial aid. My dad is already in debt because of my college fees now if I pile up even more expenses on him it would be very difficult for him to manage that. We all are aware about the importance of data and data related services in our daily life along with programming that is why I took this field because I wanted to help my father with the expenses and in order to do that I have to learn as much as I can in as little time and money. I hope the authorities of coursera understand what I am going through and help me in this journey.

Data Science and Analytics are the backbone of the Computer Science field and play a major part with there contribution to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, this course will help me take on the different problems that I face in everyday coding problems and in order to achieve the dream of getting a good job in the respective field I need to be well versed with Tools required for Data Science. This course will provide me the foundation that I require, once the foundation is set I will continue the series of courses and try and master this field of vast importance. I have previously completed The python for everybody program diligently and with a great score and am keenly looking to improve and hence expand my knowledge in Python and Data Science. Completing this course will also have a big impact in my CV and profile, also the learned instructors and mentorâ€™s teachings will have a great impact on how I perceive the subject. Hence all in all this course is very important and is in the need of the hour for me so that I can gain both Certificate and Knowledge  

I study in a country like India where there is almost no part time working culture for students and hence me being a student and not earning any money it is difficult for me to pay loans when I already have student loan, I hope the coursera authorities understand my problem and consider my demand for financial aid.
