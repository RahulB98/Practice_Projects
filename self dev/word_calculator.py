word = '''Food is an essential part of our daily survival, some have resources for a flamboyant version of it, while others are not so privileged. However, the not all the food that is bought is being consumed, which leads to the wastage of such an important resource. This is a major concern for humanity as a large number of people still sleep with a hungry stomach. This problem can be solved by taking proper steps.
With reforms in agricultural and poultry techniques has led to a drastic increase in production food resources, however the wastage of consumables has also increased drastically. Left-over food in hotels and restaurants is a source of this wastage as people tend to make their orders extravagance, thus ordering more than they can consume and later this surplus is thrown away; gets wasted. Individuals also believe in storing their food supplies as they do not wish to run out of food, which leads to the products being left on the shelves of their cupboards and become expired. They are thrown eventually as they cannot be consumed at their current state.
This situation is concerning and needs to be addressed properly. The left overs can be dealt really efficiently by donating them to the needy, either directly or through the means of several NGOs who are present to serve the same aim. Keeping a check of the food items present in the house/storage can help in consumption of food items that are close to the end of their shelf lives and thus help in prevention of wastage of precious food resource.
 The concern that tons of food being wasted is depressing and has to be put to a minimum as food is a result of shear hard work and dedication. Thus, it becomes essential that people as well as government authorities become aware about the need to work in order to stop this exploitation.
