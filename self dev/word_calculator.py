word = '''Considering a mother solely responsible for the up bringing of a child that she gives birth to is a totally absurd idea according to me and I consider that the role of a father is as important as a mother in raising their child. Not only the presence of a father is beneficial for the child, but also helpful for the mother as well.
In the animal world, a human child is one of the most demanding offspring and requires a lot of pampering and care as it grows, moreover a human child is very vulnerable in its early stages, thus involvement of two partners in raising the child reduces the burden that is experienced by a sole up bringer. Further-more the presence and involvement of father along with mother ensures that the needs of a child are met more completely.
Having the farther and his involvement in the childhood of a child also serves as a major psychological advantage for the child. It is observed in various studies that having a father in the house leads to more subtle development of the children as they grow up to become more sound individuals. For example, many august personalities such as the rapper Eminem have talked about the severe effects of absence of their father in their childhood and how difficult this absence made their life to be.
Not everyone is lucky to have a father to look up to in their life, but for those who have him, it is nothing less than a blessing. Both the mother and the child benefit from the interactions with a patriarchal figure in the family, and thus Fatherhood is as important as motherhood.
